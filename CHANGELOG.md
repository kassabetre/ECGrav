# Changelog

All notable changes to ECGrav are documented here. The format is based on
[Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/). Versioning is
semantic-ish; breaking changes are called out explicitly.

## [1.2.0] - 2026-07-17

First openly published, MIT-licensed release — a cleaned-up, tested, and
documented line of development. The earlier codebase is preserved on the
`v1.1.0` and `v1.0.0` tags (whose history is unrelated to this one).

### Added
- MIT `LICENSE`.
- `README.md` with an overview, install instructions, verified quickstart
  examples, and an API map by theme.
- `ROADMAP.md` tracking documentation and release work.
- `Tests/` — a `.wlt` regression suite (63 tests) runnable via `TestReport`,
  loading the package from source. See `Tests/README.md`.
- `.gitignore` and `.gitattributes` (build tree ignored; the built `.paclet`
  kept and marked binary; Wolfram source tagged for GitHub language stats).
- Installable `build/ECGrav-1.2.0.paclet` artifact.

### Changed
- **Breaking:** `GraphParallelTempering` — the `minEtoBeat` (minimum-energy-to-beat)
  argument moved to the **last** position in the overloads that take it
  explicitly, making the argument order consistent across overloads. Update any
  calls that previously passed it as the third argument.
- `HIsing` reimplemented to compute its sums directly with `Total` instead of
  building an all-ones matrix — faster, with identical results.
- Monte Carlo progress messages now use `PrintTemporary` (self-clearing) instead
  of `Print`.
- Warning conditions now raise proper `Message[...]` calls instead of `Print`.

### Fixed
- `Branchedness` no longer misreads a facet list as an adjacency matrix (which
  leaked a `Null` into the result); facet-list input is routed through
  `GraphFromCliques`, matching how `RmsPurity` handles its input.
- `LowEnergyStates` no longer divides by `$KernelCount`, so it no longer fails
  with `Power::infy` when called before `LaunchKernels[]` (now `Max[$KernelCount, 1]`).
- Restored the diagnostic plots (`ListLinePlot` / `Plot`) emitted by
  `GraphEquilibriate`, `GraphComputeCorrelationTime`, `GraphMultiHistogram`,
  `GraphCTLSchedule`, `ConstrainedProbConjugateField`, and the density-plot
  functions, which had been removed during an earlier debug-print cleanup.
- Fixed a variable-shadowing bug in `GraphMetropolis`: a local `N` shadowed the
  built-in numeric-evaluation symbol and has been renamed to `vCount`.

### Removed
- Dead `LandauFreeEnergy` declaration (usage/error messages with no
  implementation behind them).
- Extensive debug `Print` scaffolding throughout the Monte Carlo code.

### Known issues
- `CombinatorialSphereQ[torus]` returns `True` (a torus is not a sphere).
- `ExactExpectationValue` emits a stray `Part::partd` message (the result is
  still correct). See `Tests/README.md`.

## [1.1.0] — preserved as tag `v1.1.0`

Pre-1.2.0 codebase (unrelated history; reconstructed from its commit log):

- Added `Visualize2DComplex` and `OrientableCombinatorialManifoldQ`.
- Added parallel-tempering capability with an optional `delH`.
- Bug fixes in `Sph`, `Bll`, and other complex/graph functions.

## [1.0.0] — preserved as tag `v1.0.0`

- Initial version.
